Program to test different blackjack strategies

This program allows you to test 5 different strategies:
- standardstrategy : common strategy that is used by many blackjack players
- dealerstrategy: how the dealer plays in a blackjack round (S17)
- randomstrategy: flipping a coin to decide whether to hit or stand
- onehit: hit once if your card value is less than 13
- greaterthandealer: hit if your card value is less than that of the dealer's plus 7

This program does not include doubling or splitting

When the program is run, It prompts for which strategy to run, as well as how many times to run it. 
Then it will prompt you whether you want to run a single simulation or a distribution experiment. 
If you chose distribution experiment it will ask you how many times you want to run the simulation.
